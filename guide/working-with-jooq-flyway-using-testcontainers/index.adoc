In this guide, you will learn how to

* Create a Spring Boot application with jOOQ support
* Generate jOOQ code using Testcontainers, Flyway and Maven Plugin
* Implement basic database operations using jOOQ
* Implement logic to load complex object graph using jOOQ
* Test the jOOQ persistence layer using Testcontainers

== Prerequisites
* Java 17+
* Your favorite IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code)
* A Docker environment supported by Testcontainers https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/

== What we are going to achieve in this guide
We are going to create a Spring Boot project using https://www.jooq.org/[jOOQ] together with Postgres.
We will create our database tables by using https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] Database migrations.
We will configure https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin[testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin] to generate jOOQ code using Testcontainers and Flyway
migration scripts.

We will implement our persistence layer repositories using jOOQ to manage Users, Posts, and Comments.
Then we will test the repositories using Spring Boot testing support and Testcontainers Postgres module.

== Getting Started
Create a new Spring Boot project from https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] by selecting Maven as build tool and add the starters
*JOOQ Access Layer*, *Flyway Migration*, *Spring Boot DevTools*, *PostgreSQL Driver* and *Testcontainers*.

*jOOQ (jOOQ Object Oriented Querying)* is a popular open-source library that provides a fluent API for building typesafe SQL queries.

In order to leverage the benefits of TypeSafe DSL provided by jOOQ, we need to generate Java code from our database tables, views, and other objects, which will allow us to interact with the database using a fluent and intuitive API.

[TIP]
To learn more about how jOOQ code-generator will help you, please read
https://blog.jooq.org/why-you-should-use-jooq-with-code-generation/[Why You Should Use jOOQ With Code Generation].

In production-grade applications, it is highly recommended to use a database migration tool such as
*Flyway* or *Liquibase* to apply any changes to the database.

So, the usual process of building and testing the application by generating jOOQ java code from the database is:

* Create an instance of database using Testcontainers
* Apply Flyway or Liquibase database migrations
* Run jOOQ code-generator to generate Java code from the database objects.
* Run integration tests

The jOOQ code generation can be automated as part of the Maven build process using the
https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin[testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin].

[NOTE]
You can also use the official jOOQ code generator maven plugin by using *jooq-codegen-maven*, *groovy-maven-plugin* and *flyway-maven-plugin*
together as described in https://blog.jooq.org/using-testcontainers-to-generate-jooq-code/.

With jOOQ, https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/coming-from-jpa/from-jpa-database-first/[the database comes first].
So, let's start with creating our database structure using Flyway migration scripts.

== Create Flyway database migration scripts

In our sample application, we have users, posts and comments tables.
Let's create our first migration script following the Flyway naming convention.

Create `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_tables.sql` file as follows:

[source,sql]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_tables.sql[]
----

Note that at the end of the SQL script, we have set our database sequence values to start with 101
so that we can insert some sample data along with primary key values for testing.

== Configure jOOQ code generation using Maven plugin
Configure the *testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin* in `pom.xml` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <testcontainers.version>1.19.8</testcontainers.version>
    <testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin.version>0.0.4</testcontainers-jooq-codegen-maven-plugin.version>
    <jooq.version>3.18.3</jooq.version>
    <postgresql.version>42.6.0</postgresql.version>
</properties>

                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

Let's understand the plugin configuration.

* As we are using PostgreSQL database, we have configured the postgres JDBC driver and Testcontainers postgresql libraries as dependencies of the plugin.
* Under `<configuration>/<database>` section, we have configured the type of the database, POSTGRES, that we want to use it for our code generation, and specified the Docker image name, `postgres:16-alpine`, which will be used to create the database instance.
* Under `<configuration>/<flyway>` section we have specified the location of Flyway migration scripts path.
* We have also configured the *packageName* and *target* location for the generated code. You can configure all the configuration options supported by the official *jooq-code-generator* plugin.

[NOTE]
We have explicitly configured the versions of jOOQ, Testcontainers, Postgresql driver in
the `<properties>` section. But with Spring Boot 3.1.0 version, these property values are already defined in the parent `pom.xml`.
So, unless you want to override these versions, you don't need to explicitly configure these library versions in the `<properties>` section.

The plugin uses Testcontainers to spin up an instance of PostgreSQL container, apply Flyway migrations
and then generate the java code using jOOQ code generation tool.

With this configuration in place, now if you run `./mvnw clean package` then you can find
the generated code under the `target/generated-sources/jooq` directory.

== Create model classes
We may want to create our own model classes to represent the data structures that
we want to return for various use-cases. Imagine we are building a REST API,
and we may want to return responses with only a subset of column values from our tables.

So, let's create User, Post and Comment classes as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/User.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/Post.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/Comment.java[]
----

== Implementing basic database operations using jOOQ

Let's implement methods to create a new user and get user by email using jOOQ as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/UserRepository.java[]
----

You can see jOOQ DSL looks very similar to SQL but written in Java. By using jOOQ generated code,
we can keep our code in-sync with the database structure and also benefit from the type safety.

For example, the where condition `where(USERS.EMAIL.equalIgnoreCase(email))` expects a String for
the email value. If you try to pass any non-string value like `where(USERS.EMAIL.equalIgnoreCase(123))`
then it will give you a compiler error preventing you from making mistakes at the compilation time itself rather than at runtime.

Spring Boot provides multiple ways to write tests based on the scope of the "unit" you are testing.
If you want to test only the repository, then you can use the test slice annotations
like `@JdbcTest`, `@DataJpaTest`, `@JooqTest`, etc, whereas if you want to write an integration test
by loading the entire application context, then you can use `@SpringBootTest` annotation.

Before writing the tests, let's create an SQL script to set up the test data by
creating `src/test/resources/test-data.sql` file as follows:

[source,sql]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/resources/test-data.sql[]
----

== Write repository test using @JooqTest slice annotation
By using `@JooqTest`, SpringBoot loads only the persistence layer components and auto-configures
jOOQ's `DSLContext`.

In order to test the repository, we need to have a running Postgres database instance.
We will use Testcontainers special JDBC URL to easily start a Postgres database and write the tests
as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/UserRepositoryJooqTest.java[]
----

Let's understand what is going on in this test:

* We have used `@JooqTest` slice test annotation to only load persistence layer components and auto-configure `DSLContext`.
* We have used the Testcontainers special JDBC URL as `spring.datasource.url` property value which will automatically spin up a PostgreSQL container and configure Spring context to use it as DataSource.
* As we have `flyway-core` dependency added, Spring Boot will automatically execute the Flyway migrations placed in `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory.
* We have injected jOOQ's `DSLContext` and instantiated `UserRepository` using JUnit's `@BeforeEach` callback method.
* Finally, our tests invoke the `UserRepository` methods and verified the expected return values.

== Write Integration Test using @SpringBootTest

We can write integration tests using `@SpringBootTest` annotation which will load the entire application context.
While you can use the Testcontainers special JDBC url with `@SpringBootTest` too,
let us see how we can use Testcontainers with *ServiceConnection* support introduced in Spring Boot 3.1.0.

[TIP]
Learn more about the Testcontainers support introduced in Spring Boot 3.1.0 at
https://www.atomicjar.com/2023/05/spring-boot-3-1-0-testcontainers-for-testing-and-local-development/[Spring Boot Application Testing and Development with Testcontainers]

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/UserRepositoryTest.java[]
----

Let's understand what is going on here:

* We have used `@SpringBootTest` annotation which loads the entire application context because of which we are able to directly inject the `UserRepository` bean.
* We have used Testcontainers JUnit 5 Extension annotations `@Testcontainers` and `@Container` to spin up a PostgreSQL container and used `@ServiceConnection` to auto-configure the datasource properties.
* We have initialized the test data using `@Sql("/test-data.sql")`
* The tests are similar to the tests we have written using `@JooqTest` slice annotation in the previous section.

== Fetching complex object trees using jOOQ

So far we have seen using jOOQ to perform very basic database operations.
But jOOQ shines when it comes to querying the database with complex queries, stored procedures, etc.

In our database model, we have Many-To-One relationship from Post-to-User, One-To-Many relationship from Post-to-Comment.

Let us see how we can get a `Post` for a given `postId` along with the created user and its comments
using jOOQ powerful *MULTISET* feature using a single query.

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/main/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/PostRepository.java[]
----

We have used jOOQ's https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/nested-records/[Nested records support] for
loading the ManyToOne association of Post-to-User and https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/multiset-value-constructor/[MULTISET] feature for loading OneToMany association of Post-to-Comments.

To learn more about jOOQ's MULTISET feature, please refer https://blog.jooq.org/jooq-3-15s-new-multiset-operator-will-change-how-you-think-about-sql/

[TIP]
From jOOQ 3.19, fetching the associations using MULTISET is further simplified using https://www.jooq.org/doc/dev/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/select-statement/implicit-path-correlation/[implicit path correlations feature].

We can write integration test for `PostRepository` as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{codebase}/src/test/java/com/testcontainers/demo/domain/PostRepositoryTest.java[]
----

== Run tests

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw test
----

You should see all tests PASS. You can also notice that after tests are executed, the containers are stopped and removed automatically.

== Summary
The Testcontainers library helped us to generate java code from the database using
jOOQ code generator tool, and we are able to write tests by using the same type of database,
PostgreSQL, that we use in production as opposed to using mocks or in-memory databases.

As we are always generating the code from the current state of the database, 
we can ensure that our code is in sync with the database changes, and we are free to do
any code refactoring and still ensure that the application is working as expected.
